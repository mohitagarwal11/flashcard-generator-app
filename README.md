Thank you for checking out my latest but longest project, time wise! This project is my first web project that uses actual AI calls.
I learnt a lot from this project, from AI API calls to debugging, parsing and prompting the AI the right way(Debugging wasnt easy mind you ;( )
I have plans to make a backend for this as well but i am little behind on my backend skills.
A working backend would allow me to add so many more new features, it will be brilliant!

Anyway, if u liked this project do check out the others. <3
